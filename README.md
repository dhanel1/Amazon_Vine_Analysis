Overview of the analysis
In the Business world, consumer ratings are important in determining customer approval of certian products. Analysing consumer reviews can give business insight into areas that need improvement, and ways to make products more friendly to their base. Its also  a way to find any problems with certian products that have passed through the testing phase.
In this Module we analyzed the video game sector of Amazon using amazon data bases, to find any correlations in the information. 

Results
Python was used to extract the raw data from Pyspark, so we we able to find meaningful connections amoungst the large amount of informaton. Vine tables were created to show the ratings on select video games. The categories that were extracted were star rating, helpful votes, vine, and verified purchase. Next on Python we analyzed the difference of 5 star reviews between unpaid and paid reviews. While paid had a 5 star percentage rate of 38.7.

Summary 
There is a bias between star rating and piad vs unpaid. The paid category rank consistently higher than the unpaid section. This was a significant correlation fond in analzying video game reviews. In the future much more can be done with Amazon reviews to find data trends. Firstly video game category could be helpful data to see what genre of video games have the highest rating. Secondly Its important to differentiate the reviews, the reviews based off the game, and reviews based off Amazon's service. This would be much more helpful to Amazon, as it will highlight issues with the delivery service.
